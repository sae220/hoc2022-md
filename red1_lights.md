# Lights

## Step 1
There's seems to be a pattern with the way the lights are flashing. Move the Enderman to each spot matching the pattern the lights are making.

The included example code is broken, can you fix it? Debug the code by running it to see what it does and then edit it to the correct solution.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||hoc22.move enderman butler||`` blocks to move the Enderman butler to the correct lights. Pay attention to the pattern of the lights. Your code should match that pattern. 



```ghost
    hoc22.npcMoveLightBlue()
    hoc22.npcMovePink()
    hoc22.npcMoveLime()
    hoc22.npcMoveYellow()
```
```template
    hoc22.npcMoveLime() 
    hoc22.npcMoveYellow()
```
```package
