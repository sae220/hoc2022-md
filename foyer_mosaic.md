# Picture Slide

## Step 1
It seems like the picture got scrambled! Let's see if we can push the blocks around to put the picture back in order.

The included example code is broken, can you fix it? Debug the code by running it to see what it does and then edit it to the correct solution.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||hoc22.push <color> <direction>||`` blocks to trigger the pistons in order to move the blocks in the selected direction. It takes a minimum of three moves to put the picture back in order.

```ghost
    hoc22.mosaicPushUp()
    hoc22.mosaicPushDown()
    hoc22.mosaicPushLeft()
    hoc22.mosaicPushRight()
```
```template
    hoc22.mosaicPushLeft()
    hoc22.mosaicPushRight()
    hoc22.mosaicPushDown()
```

```package
minecraft-hoc22=github:sae220/hoc22-ts
```
