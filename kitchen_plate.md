# Plate Swap

## Step 1
It seems the Zombie Chef gave everyone the wrong meal! Search the kitchen for the menu and make sure everyone ends up with the correct meal. You only need to add one block to the end of the debug code.

The included example code is broken, can you fix it? Debug the code by running it to see what it does and then edit it to the correct solution.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||hoc22.swap <color> side||`` blocks to swap the dishes until everyone has their correct meals. The minimum amount of swaps required is three.
