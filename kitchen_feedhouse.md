# Feed the House

## Step 1
The house is hungry! And what better to feed it than apples, salmon, and mushroom stew! See if you could figure out how many of each item the house requires. 

The included example code is broken, can you fix it? Debug the code by running it to see what it does and then edit it to the correct solution.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Pay attention to how many Zombie Chefs go by with each ingredient. Use the ``||hoc22.feed house <ingredient>||`` blocks to feed the house the required amount.

```ghost
    hoc22.feedHouseApple(1)
    hoc22.feedHouseSalmon(1)
    hoc22.feedHouseMushroomStew(1)

```
```template
    hoc22.feedHouseApple(2)
    hoc22.feedHouseSalmon(1)
```

```package
minecraft-hoc22=github:ReWrite-Media/hoc22-ts#v0.4.0
